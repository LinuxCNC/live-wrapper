Introduction
============

live-wrapper is a tool produced by the `Debian Live Team
<https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/>`_ that can be used to create
Debian-based live images for use with CDs, DVDs or USB sticks.

live-wrapper is designed to, as far as is possible, exist only as glue between
existing tools. The root filesystem is built using `vmdebootstrap` and
isohybrid image creation is provided by `xorriso`.
