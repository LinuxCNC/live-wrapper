  [ Iain R. Learmonth ]
  * Core:
   - Logging has seen some improvements
   - Subdirectories within the CD root are now handled by a helper class
  * Installer:
   - Live image builds will now have installers by default
   - Daily builds, not release builds, are now used (an option to select this
     will appear in a future version)
   - Packages and Release files are generated for the CD-ROM pool
   - Hardcoded disk metadata (.disk) is added to enable the installer
  * Live System:
   - Default customise script fixes permissions on squashfs root (workaround
     for #843983)
   - systemd-networkd is no longer used in the live system
  * Bootloaders:
   - Bootloader files are only installed in the CD root when requested
   - Bootloader configurations are now shared between ISOLINUX and GRUB

  [ Ana C. Custura ]
  * Utilities:
   - memtest86+ can now be installed into the image through a command line flag
   - Hardware Detection Tool can now be installed into the image through a
     command line flag (not yet installed in the bootloader menu though)
  * Bootloaders:
   - Menu entries for booting memtest86+ and HDT exist in the abstract
     configuration (though are not yet serialised to the configurations
     written)
   - The installer can now be launched from either bootloader, either text-mode
     or graphical

  Thanks to the sponsors of the vmdebootstrap sprint, where the majority of
  these changes were made.
